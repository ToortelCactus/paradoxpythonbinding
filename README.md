Python alternative to Victoria 3 modding

Currently only events are supported. Minimal validation.

Usage:
- in defines.py change the MOD_PATH to your actual mod path
- open main.py and write events there or just use this code as a library in your own python scripts
- run your script/main.py, files will be generated

Adding enums of existing objects:
- go to "parser" folder and run parser.py, it will recreate generated enum files
