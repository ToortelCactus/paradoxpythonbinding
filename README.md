Python alternative to Victoria 3 modding

Currently only events are supported. Minimal validation.

Usage:
- open main.py and write events there or just use this code as a library in your own python scripts

Adding enums of existing objects:
- go to "parser" folder and run parser.py, it will recreate generated enum files
